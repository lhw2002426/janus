 * complex topology so it is only of value for Jupiter like topology.
 *
 * TODO: Maybe there is a better abstraction here?  Thankfully, this works for

 * should break down the aggregate switches into smaller blocks.  Each
 * aggregate should have its own block.  Similarly, each k-identical core
 * switches should be in the same block.
