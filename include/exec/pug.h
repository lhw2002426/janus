 * Ah the good ol' pug (or Janus or LaLa).
 *
 * Pug has three modes of operation:
 *
 * - pug: which uses predictions of short-term traffic together with long-term
 *   predictions (pug-long) to plan.
 * - pug-long: which plans based on the full history of the traffic.
 * - pug-lookback: which uses the most n-recent TMs as an estimation of the
 *   long-term trend of traffic.  For the short-term prediction it operates
 *   similar to pug.
 *
 * pug seems to be having problem in general because the pug-long predictions
 * can be way off at times.  pug-lookback works better than pug due to this
 * exact reason.  That long-term predictions are more sensible.

 * A plan repository of possible plans of length max_plan_size for pug.
 *
 * Internally pug uses _plan_invalidate_not_equal, _cur_index, and plan_count to
 * splice the space of possible subplans by subplans we have already chosen.
 *
 * E.g., if our choices of plans are:
 *
 * [0 , 1, 3]
 * [10, 1, 4]
 * [10, 2, 5]
 *
 * and we choose subplan 10 as our first step, we can invalidate plans that do
 * not start with 10.  So our choices are limited to:
 *
 * [10, 1, 4]
 * [10, 2, 5]
 *
 * To make restoration of plan_repo_t easier (so we can do this continously at
 * each step and won't need to regenerate it) we just swap invalidate plan with
 * an element that is valid, but adjust plan_count accordingly to make sure we
 * don't iterate over that plan.  In the previous example:
 * 
 * [10, 1, 4]
 * [10, 2, 5]
 * [0 , 1, 3]
 *
 * plan_count = 2, initial_plan_count = 3
 *
 * If we want to "reset" the planner, we just set the plan_count to 3 and all
 * plans become valid again.
